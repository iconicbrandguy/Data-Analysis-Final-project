### **Project Title and Short Description**

**Title:**
**Global Analysis and Visualization of COVID-19 Trends Using JupyterLab**

**Short Description:**
This project conducts a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging global datasets to uncover patterns and insights across countries. It utilizes Python-based data science tools in JupyterLab to clean, process, and visualize COVID-19 case progression, deaths, testing rates, and critical care statistics, focusing on countries such as the USA, India, and Kenya.

### **Objectives of the Project**

1. **Analyze and visualize** the global distribution and progression of COVID-19 cases over time.
2. **Examine the impact** of demographic and socioeconomic variables (like population size, testing rates) on COVID-19 outcomes.
3. **Clean and prepare data** for meaningful comparisons between countries.
4. **Generate visual insights** to support policy recommendations on healthcare preparedness and crisis response.
5. **Compare case progression** in selected countries (USA, India, Kenya) to explore regional trends and disparities.

### **List of Tools and Libraries Used**

* **JupyterLab** – Integrated development environment for interactive data analysis.
* **Python** – Primary programming language.
* **Pandas** – For data loading, cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis.
* **Matplotlib** – For generating visualizations (line plots for case counts, deaths, etc.).
* **NumPy** – (implicitly used with Pandas).
* **CSV Dataset** – "updated\_with\_dates.csv" containing COVID-19 stats for over 200 countries.

### **How to Run/View the Project**

1. **Set Up Environment:**

   * Use Anaconda or a similar environment with JupyterLab installed.
   * Ensure `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries are available (`pip install pandas matplotlib` if needed).

2. **Steps to Run:**

   * Open the `.ipynb` notebook in JupyterLab or run the Python script in cells (as shown in the PDF).
   * Load the dataset (`updated_with_dates.csv`).
   * Execute the data cleaning steps (drop nulls or interpolate missing values).
   * Run the visualization blocks to see:

     * Total cases over time.
     * Total deaths over time.
     * Daily new cases per country.

3. **Visual Output:**
   Interactive graphs comparing total and new COVID-19 cases over time among selected countries (e.g., USA, India, Kenya).

### **Any Insights or Reflections**

* **Data Quality Matters:** The presence of missing data (e.g., new cases, deaths) required extensive cleaning before analysis. Interpolation and filtering were critical for accuracy.
* **Different Trajectories:** The comparison showed how countries like the USA experienced significantly earlier and higher spikes compared to others like Kenya.
* **Testing and Detection:** Countries with higher testing per capita (e.g., USA) generally reported more accurate trends, underlining the role of surveillance in pandemic management.
* **Tool Effectiveness:** JupyterLab combined with Pandas and Matplotlib proved effective for rapid prototyping, data manipulation, and visualization, making it ideal for health data analytics.
